### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Lab 7 part 1 I really liked this lab a lot because of how helpful it can be in real life scenarios. This code can be applicable for finding out how many days have passed given two dates. For example this code could also be very helpful if you're planning your anniversary and want to find out how much time has passed since the first time you both have met.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6 part 1 I really liked this lab in particular because this was the 1st lab where we started to incorporate arguments into our code. I also liked how this code made us use sandwiches to help us understand arguments better. For example 1 was our sandwich, 2 was our meat, 3 was our bread, and 4 was our condiments. 

* Lab 7

    Lab 7 part 2 This lab in particular was very challenging but I liked the concept of the lab a lot. Making a game like black jack incorporates a lot of what we had learned throughout the semester. Though this code was challenging it was very rewarding once we finished.
